# FISHspace is based on stlearn

https://github.com/BiomedicalMachineLearning/stLearn

We readaped stlearn to our needs and added our [FISHscale package](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/FISHscale) for handling FISH data.  
When setting up FISHspace, please refer to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/FISHspace/blob/master/requirements.txt) and [environment.yml](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/FISHspace/blob/master/environment.yml) files.
